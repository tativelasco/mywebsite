I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Education at Teachers College - Columbia University, and a National Academy of Education / Spencer Foundation Dissertation Fellow. My research focuses on the relation between education policies and economic inequality, with a focus on higher education and the transition to the labor market.
