### About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/me.png" >}}

Welcome to my website. I am an applied microeconomist studying the relation between education policies and economic inequality, with a focus on higher education, financial aid policies and the transition to the labor market. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Education from Teachers College - Columbia University, and I am a National Academy of Education / Spencer Foundation Dissertation Fellow. Starting this summer, I will be a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Policy Research in The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
