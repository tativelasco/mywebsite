### About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/me.png" >}}

Welcome to my website. I am an applied microeconomist studying the relation between education policies and economic inequality. Currently, I am a Research Associate at the Community College Research Center (CCRC) at Teachers College, Columbia University. At CCRC, I study students' transitions into, through and out of college, with a particular focus on dual enrollment and transfer policies, as well as on the relationships with local labor markets. My research also examines the intersection between education policies and other aspects of students' behavior, such as social interactions and network formation, and how this shapes student outcomes. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Education from Teachers College - Columbia University.
