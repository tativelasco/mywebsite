### About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/me.png" >}}

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics and Education at Teachers College - Columbia University. My research studies the relation between education policies and economic inequality, with a focus on higher education and the transition to the labor market. My work leverages administrative data with policy evaluation methods. I am particularly interested in the role of financial aid policies and its impacts on segregation and on student behaviors as determinants of academic success and social mobility.
