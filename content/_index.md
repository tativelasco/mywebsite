### About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/me.png" >}}

Welcome to my website. I am an applied microeconomist studying the relation between education policies and economic inequality, with a focus on higher education, financial aid policies and the transition to the labor market. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Education from Teachers College - Columbia University. Currently, I am a Research Associate at the Community College Research Center (CCRC) at Teachers College, Columbia University. At CCRC, I study students' transitions into, through and out of college, with a particular focus on dual enrollment and transfer policies, as well as on the relationships with local labor markets.
