Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Education at Teachers College - Columbia University, and a National Academy of Education / Spencer Foundation Dissertation Fellow. My research focuses on the relation between education policies and economic inequality, with a focus on higher education, financial aid policies and the transition to the labor market. I will be on the 2021-22 job market.
