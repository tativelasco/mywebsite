#### [The Effect of College Desegregation on Academic Achievement and Students’ Social Interactions: Evidence from Turnstile Data (Job Market Paper)](/static/VelascoRodriguez_JMP_October_2021_Columbia.pdf)
Efforts to desegregate schools by helping low–income students attend elite institutions have spread around the world. However, the benefits of socioeconomic integration may fail to emerge if social interactions within schools remain segregated. In this paper, I study a natural experiment at an elite university that experienced a sharp and unexpected increase in its enrollment of low–-income students, and use it to measure the effect of desegregation policies on students' social interactions and academic achievement. To identify students' interactions, I develop a measure based on students' co-movements across campus as recorded by turnstiles guarding all entrances. Increasing exposure to desegregation led to the diversification of students' social interactions with no adverse effects on academic achievement. Moreover, I find at least half of the increase in interactions between wealthy and low--income students is explained by interactions with low--income high--achieving students, which is consistent with a model where wealthy students links other low--income students by avoiding adverse peer effects.

#### The Returns to College for Low-income students: Evidence from a Student Loan Program in Colombia (co-authored with F. Sanchez)
This paper examines the returns to college investments for low–income youth participating in a student loan program in Colombia. The loan's policy setup plus the rules determining eligibility enable an instrumental variable research design that isolates exogenous changes in the number of college terms attained. Plus, the loan assignment rule allows examining individuals over all the distribution of academic achievement. First, we find the loan has a significantly positive impact on the probability of college enrollment, completion, and the cumulative number of college terms attained. Plus, the loan has a positive effect on average daily wages of 13 percent. Our estimates of the returns to college investments indicate that the average wage premium to an additional college term is 3.5 percent. Importantly, we find these returns are driven by achieving college completion, as students who do not earn a degree experience a return below 3 percent. Our findings suggest low–income students do experience significantly positive returns to college investments but that policies targeting low–income youth should place a strong emphasis on boosting college completion. This paper overcomes the limitations of prior research that has estimated returns to college education by either using natural experiments or by estimating effects at the margin of policy eligibility based on different rules.
